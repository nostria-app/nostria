Made by latest Grok 4.20 model:

**Here are the easiest, highest-leverage ways to grow Nostria's user base with minimal ongoing time investment.** You've already nailed the hard part: a genuinely superior client (multi-column feeds, local AI for dictation/translation/read-aloud, live streams, AV recording, long-form, no-email 2-click onboarding, true data ownership, no ads/tracking, and custom infra for global scale). That's a massive differentiator in a space where most clients feel clunky or limited.

Nostr's user base is still niche (strong in Bitcoin/privacy/creator circles, but growth has flattened in late 2025), so the winning moves are **product-led growth + organic community amplification** rather than broad ads or heavy campaigns. Focus on what takes <30-60 min/day or one-time batches.

### 1. Consistent, low-effort posting on Nostr + X (your highest-ROI channel, 15 min/day)
Nostr users live on Nostr *and* X. Post short, visual feature demos 3–5x per week from your @NostriaApp / @SondreB accounts (cross-post automatically if possible).

- Examples that work: "Watch me dictate a note in 3 seconds with local AI → no cloud, no tracking" (screen recording), "Multi-column feeds in action – finally a Nostr client that feels like power-user Twitter", "Live stream discovery inside Nostria", "Why I switched from Primal/Damus (side-by-side)".
- Add a clear CTA: "Try it free at nostria.app – no email needed".
- Engage: Reply to every mention/comment, zap active users who try it, use #Nostr #Bitcoin #DecentralizedSocial.
- Why it works: Word-of-mouth is everything in Nostr. Primal grew this way; your USPs (local AI + smoothness + scale) are perfect for "holy shit" moments that get reposted/zapped.

Batch 5–7 posts/screenshots in one 45-min session using your phone's screen recorder + CapCut.

### 2. One-time App Store Optimization (ASO) + review prompts (2–3 hours total, then passive)
Update your App Store / Google Play listings today:

- Title/subtitle: Include high-search keywords like "Nostr Client", "AI Nostr", "Decentralized Social Network", "Multi Column Nostr".
- Screenshots: Lead with the 30-second wins (local AI dictation, multi-column, live streams). Add captions.
- Description: Front-load "No email. No tracking. Local AI. Global scale." + feature bullets.

Inside the app, add a non-intrusive "Loving Nostria? Leave a 5-star review" after first few sessions (or after a "win" like first zap/long-form post). Even 10–20 new reviews can boost visibility dramatically.

This is pure passive growth—users searching "best Nostr client" or "Nostr AI" will find you.

### 3. Quick in-app viral loops (1–2 dev hours, then automatic)
Add these simple features if not already there (you control the product):

- One-tap "Invite friends → both get 7-day premium" (or a badge/zap credit). Link: nostria.app/invite?ref=yournpub.
- "Share this note from Nostria" button that auto-tags @NostriaApp and adds "Built with local AI – try Nostria".
- Post-onboarding nudge: "Your first note is live! Share your profile link".

These create network effects with almost zero ongoing work. Nostr loves zaps and referrals—lean into it.

### 4. Update directories & GitHub once (1 hour)
- nostrapps.com already lists you—make sure the description highlights local AI + multi-platform + "global scale".
- Add/update on awesome-nostr lists, nostr.how/clients, and any other directories (quick Google "Nostr client list").
- GitHub (24 stars right now): Pin the repo, update README with a beautiful screenshot + "Try live: nostria.app" + contribution call ("Star if you like the vision"). Share the repo link in every post.

### 5. Targeted 30-min/week influencer/outreach sprints
DM 3–5 active Nostr/Bitcoin creators or power users per week (use Nostr search or X #Nostr). Personalize:

"Love your takes on decentralized social. Built Nostria with local AI models + true multi-column feeds—thought you might dig the smoothness. Free premium for a week if you want to try: [link]. No pressure."

Focus on people who complain about current clients (slow feeds, no AI, discovery issues). Many will post organically if they like it. Nostr's small size means 5–10 good shoutouts can add hundreds of users.

### 6. Batch short demo content (one 2-hour session → weeks of fuel)
Record 8–10 vertical 15–30s clips:
- "Nostria vs other clients: speed test"
- "Local AI translation while scrolling"
- "How I run live streams natively"

Post one per day across X, Nostr, YouTube Shorts, TikTok (tag #Nostr). Reuse the same assets forever.

### Bonus quick wins (pick 1–2)
- Add a simple community Discord/Telegram linked from the app and website (or use existing if you have one).
- Run a one-week "Nostria Challenge": best thread using local AI features wins sats (costs little, generates content).
- Localization: Even just German/Spanish/Portuguese screenshots + keywords can unlock non-English markets (Bitcoin communities are global).

**Start here this week (total time <4 hours):**
1. Post 3 feature demos today.
2. Update ASO + add review prompt.
3. Implement basic referral link.
4. DM 5 people.

Track what works with simple UTM links (nostria.app/?utm_source=x) or your premium user growth. The Nostr community rewards builders who ship great UX and show up authentically— you're already doing both. You've got the best client; now let the network do the rest.

If you share more details (e.g., current DAU, what you've tried, or specific features ready to highlight), I can refine this into a 7-day action plan. Let's get Nostria everywhere. 🚀
