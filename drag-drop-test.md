# Drag and Drop Test Plan

## Test 1: Column Reordering Preserves State
1. Open the application at http://localhost:4200
2. Navigate to the feeds page
3. Scroll down in one of the columns to see some content
4. Drag and drop that column to a different position
5. **Expected Result**: The column should maintain its scroll position and content
6. **Look for in console**: Log messages showing optimized updateColumnOrder method being used

## Test 2: Column-Specific Refresh
1. Click the refresh button on one specific column
2. **Expected Result**: Only that column should refresh, others should remain unchanged
3. **Look for in console**: Log messages showing only the specific column being refreshed

## Console Logs to Watch For:
- `ðŸ”„ Column drop event: { previousIndex: X, currentIndex: Y }`
- `ðŸ“‹ Columns reordered: [column names and IDs]`
- `âš¡ Using optimized updateColumnOrder method`
- `âš¡ FeedsCollectionService: Updating column order for feed [feedId]`
- `ðŸ”„ FeedService: Updating column order for feed [feedId]`
- `âœ… FeedService: Column order updated successfully without subscription changes`

For refresh testing:
- `ðŸ”„ Refreshing column: [column name] ([column id])`
- `ðŸ”„ FeedService: Refreshing column [columnId]`
- `âœ… FeedService: Column [columnId] refreshed successfully`

## Success Criteria:
âœ… Columns maintain scroll position during drag and drop
âœ… Content doesn't reload during column reordering
âœ… Only specific columns refresh when their refresh button is clicked
âœ… Console shows optimized methods being used
âœ… No unnecessary subscription changes during drag operations
