Making the Nostr protocol accessible to everyone, with a focus on user experience and performance for global scale.

## Installation

Nostria is accessible as both web app and desktop app.

Web: https://nostria.app

Desktop: https://github.com/nostria-app/nostria/releases

## Documentation

Documentation of source code is available here: [Nostria DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/nostria-app/nostria)

Additional documents here: [docs](docs/)

## Architecture

The client is built on Angular and Angular Material. It is utilizing Tauri to package the app for desktop users.

Nostria is a client for the Nostr protocol, which is a decentralized social network protocol. It allows users to communicate and share information without relying on a central server. The client is designed to be user-friendly and provide a seamless experience for users.

Nostria implements the usage of the Nostr protocol to ensure maximum decentralization and global scalability, without compromising on user experience. The client is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use, with a focus on providing a great user experience.

## Opininated Nostr Client

Nostria has opinions, and decisions is being made regarding parts of the Nostr protocol. There are parts that are not implemented and ignored, simply because we disagree.

Here is a list of opinions and decisions made in Nostria:

- [NIP-65: Relay List Metadata](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/65.md) - We are ignoring the READ/WRITE flags for relays and all relays are both read and writes.
- [NIP-51: Lists](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md) - Follow sets (kind:30000) and Relay sets (kind:30002) will not be implemented. They are duplicate functionality and should be ignored.
- [NIP-96: HTTP File Storage Integration](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/96.md) - This is a "duplicate" specification to Blossom, that has more features, but is additionally more complex. It allows metadata to be stored with the blob, but Nostria will not support this protocol. File storage server list (kind:10096) is therefore
  ignored.
- NIP-58: Badges: Badges should be self-contained on the user's relays. That means both the badge definition and the badge claim should be on the user's relays. This is to ensure that the user has full set of data for their own needs. Maybe Nostria will perform lookup on issuer relays
  to get updated badge definitions, but this is not a requirement. The user should be able to use the badge without relying on the issuer relay.
  That means that Nostria will publish both the badge definition and the badge claim to the user's relays.
- NIP-B0: Web Bookmarking. We are not implementing this NIP, as this is something better left to the web browser.

## Scaling Nostr

Nostria is designed to help Nostr scale. It is implementing the protocol in a way that focuses on decentralization and scalability.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) + [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template).

## Run from Code

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Alternative if you want to run the desktop app:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## Classifications

- Accounts - List of accounts that the user has access to.
- Account - This is accounts of the user within the app.
- Users - This is Nostr users. "User" and "Users" refer to Nostr users, not the current user of the app.
