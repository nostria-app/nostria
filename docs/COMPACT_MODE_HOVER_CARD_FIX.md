# Compact Mode Hover Card Support

## Summary
Added hover card functionality to the user-profile component's compact mode to provide consistent user experience across all view modes.

## Problem
The user-profile component in compact mode did not show hover cards when hovering over profile elements, while other view modes (list, details, grid) had this functionality enabled.

## Solution
Modified the `onMouseEnter` method in `user-profile.component.ts` to include `'compact'` view mode in the list of supported views for hover cards.

## Changes Made

### File: `src/app/components/user-profile/user-profile.component.ts`
- Updated the condition in `onMouseEnter` method (lines 576-582) to include `'compact'` mode
- Added `this.view() !== 'compact'` to the exclusion check

**Before:**
```typescript
if (
  this.view() !== 'list' &&
  this.view() !== 'details' &&
  this.view() !== 'grid'
) {
  return;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (
  this.view() !== 'list' &&
  this.view() !== 'details' &&
  this.view() !== 'grid' &&
  this.view() !== 'compact'
) {
  return;
}
```

## Technical Details
- The compact mode already had the necessary mouse event handlers in the HTML template
- The compact mode has its own CSS styles defined in the SCSS file (starting at line 318)
- No additional template or style changes were required
- The hover card component and overlay positioning work correctly with compact mode

## Testing
- Build completed successfully without compilation errors
- The change is minimal and low-risk as it only enables existing functionality for an additional view mode

## Impact
Users can now hover over profile elements in compact mode to see detailed profile information in a hover card, providing a consistent experience across all view modes of the user-profile component.
