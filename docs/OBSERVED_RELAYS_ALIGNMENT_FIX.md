# Observed Relays List - Alignment and Visual Improvements

## Overview
Fixed column alignment issues in the Observed Relays list and added consistent visual separators between relay rows to improve readability and prevent the "Explore" button from being clipped.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Column Misalignment
**Problem**: The grid columns had inconsistent widths causing poor alignment between header and data rows.

**Solution**: 
- Updated grid template from `40px 1fr 100px 100px 140px 120px` to `40px 1fr 120px 120px 160px 140px`
- Increased "Events" and "Connects" columns from 100px to 120px for better spacing
- Increased "Last Connected" column from 140px to 160px to accommodate longer relative times
- Increased "Actions" column from 120px to 140px to ensure "Explore" button is never clipped

### 2. Text Alignment in Columns
**Problem**: Numeric and action columns were not consistently centered/aligned.

**Solution**:
- Added `justify-content: center` to header columns (Events, Connects, Last Connected)
- Added `justify-content: flex-end` to Actions header
- Added `text-align: center` to data columns for better visual alignment

### 3. Missing Visual Separators
**Problem**: No clear visual separation between relay rows, making the list hard to scan.

**Solution**:
- Removed the `&:last-child { border-bottom: none; }` rule
- Now all relay rows have a bottom border creating clear lines between entries
- Maintains the border even for the last row for consistency

### 4. Button Clipping
**Problem**: "Explore" button could get clipped or overflow its container.

**Solution**:
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
- Set `max-width: 120px` to contain the button within the column
- Ensured button container has `align-items: center` for proper vertical alignment

## Changes Made

### Desktop Layout (>1024px)
```scss
grid-template-columns: 40px 1fr 120px 120px 160px 140px;
```
- **Column 1**: 40px - Expand/collapse button
- **Column 2**: 1fr - Relay info (name, URL, icon)
- **Column 3**: 120px - Events count (centered)
- **Column 4**: 120px - Connection count (centered)
- **Column 5**: 160px - Last connected time (centered)
- **Column 6**: 140px - Explore button (right-aligned)

### Tablet Layout (768px - 1024px)
```scss
grid-template-columns: 40px 1fr 100px 120px;
```
- Hides "Connects" and "Last Connected" columns
- Shows: Expand, Relay Info, Events, Actions
- Maintains proper alignment with adjusted widths

### Mobile Layout (<768px)
- Collapses to 2-column layout (unchanged)
- Full details in expandable section

## Visual Improvements

1. **Clear Row Separation**: Every relay now has a visible border below it
2. **Perfect Alignment**: Headers and data columns align perfectly
3. **No Clipping**: Buttons and text stay within their containers
4. **Better Readability**: Centered numeric values are easier to scan
5. **Professional Look**: Consistent spacing and alignment throughout

## Technical Details

### SCSS Changes
- Updated `.list-header` grid-template-columns
- Updated `.relay-row` grid-template-columns
- Added text alignment properties to header and data cells
- Removed last-child exception for border
- Added max-width constraint to action buttons
- Updated responsive breakpoints to match new column widths

### No HTML Changes Required
All fixes were purely CSS-based, requiring no template modifications.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with varying relay name lengths
2. Test with long event counts (1M+, 1k+)
3. Test with different screen widths (1920px, 1024px, 768px, 480px)
4. Verify "Explore" button always visible and not clipped
5. Check that all columns maintain alignment when scrolling
6. Test with different zoom levels

## Before vs After

### Before
- Columns of varying widths causing misalignment
- Header text not aligned with data below
- No visual separation between rows
- Explore button sometimes clipped
- Difficult to scan vertically

### After
- Consistent, properly sized columns
- Perfect header-to-data alignment
- Clear lines between all relay rows
- Explore button always fully visible
- Easy vertical scanning with aligned columns
- Professional table-like appearance

## Browser Compatibility

These changes use standard CSS Grid features supported by all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge 57+
- Firefox 52+
- Safari 10.1+
- Opera 44+

## Performance Impact
