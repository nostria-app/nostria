# Observed Relays Feature Redesign

## Overview
Updated the "Observed Relays" tab to use a cleaner, more compact list-based design inspired by a relay monitoring interface, replacing the previous card-based grid layout.

## Changes Made

### Template (relays.component.html)
- Replaced card-based grid with a table-like list layout
- Added collapsible row details with expand/collapse functionality
- Reorganized header to show sort controls and clear button together
- Implemented column-based layout showing:
  - Relay status icon and information
  - Event count
  - Connection attempts
  - Last connected time
  - Explore button
- Expandable details section showing:
  - First observed timestamp
  - Last updated timestamp
  - Performance score with color-coded badge
  - Remove from list action

### Component Logic (relays.component.ts)
Added new methods to support the redesigned interface:

1. **`toggleRelayDetails(url: string)`**: Toggle expanded state for a specific relay
2. **`isRelayExpanded(url: string)`**: Check if relay details are expanded
3. **`getRelayDisplayName(url: string)`**: Extract and format a friendly display name from relay URL
4. **`getSignalClass(relay)`**: Determine CSS class for signal strength indicator
5. **`formatRelativeTime(timestamp: number)`**: Format timestamps as relative time (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")

Added signal state:
- **`expandedRelays`**: Tracks which relays have their details expanded

### Styles (relays.component.scss)
- New list-based layout with header row and data rows
- Responsive grid system: 6 columns on desktop, collapsing to mobile-friendly layout
- Smooth expand/collapse animation for detail sections
- Status indicators with color coding (green for connected, yellow for disconnected, red for offline)
- Signal strength indicators with color gradients
- Performance badges with color-coded scoring
- Mobile-responsive breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, and 480px

## Design Features

### Desktop Layout (>1024px)
- Full 6-column grid showing all information
- Header row with column labels
- Hover effects on rows
- Connected relays have subtle background highlight

### Tablet Layout (768px - 1024px)
- Reduced to 4 columns (hides "Connects" and "Last Connected")
- Most important info remains visible

### Mobile Layout (<768px)
- Header hidden for cleaner appearance
- 2-column layout (expand button + relay info)
- Full-width "Explore" button
- All metrics moved to expanded details section

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Better Information Density**: More relays visible at once in list format
2. **Quick Scanning**: Column-based layout makes it easy to compare metrics across relays
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Details hidden by default, expandable on demand
4. **Visual Status Indicators**: Color-coded icons and signal strength for quick status checks
5. **Relative Time Display**: More intuitive "2h ago" format instead of full timestamps
6. **Responsive Design**: Optimized layouts for all screen sizes

## Technical Notes

- Maintained backward compatibility with existing relay data structure
- All existing functionality preserved (view info, remove relay, clear all data)
- Animation uses CSS keyframes for smooth transitions
- Grid layout uses CSS Grid for flexible, responsive design
- Color scheme uses CSS custom properties for theme consistency
