# Mute List Item Removal Fix

## Issue
The "removeMutedItem" function in the Privacy Settings page was not working - clicking the remove button for blocked accounts, muted words, tags, or threads was not actually removing items from the mute list or publishing the updated list.

## Root Cause
The `removeMutedItem` method in `privacy-settings.component.ts` was just a placeholder with only a console.log statement and no actual implementation.

## Solution
Implemented proper mute list item removal functionality by:

1. **Imported ReportingService**: Added the `ReportingService` to handle mute list operations according to NIP-51 (Nostr Lists) protocol.

2. **Injected ReportingService**: Added service injection in the component constructor.

3. **Implemented removeMutedItem method**: Replaced the placeholder with a proper async implementation that:
   - Handles different mute item types (account, word, tag, thread)
   - Uses appropriate ReportingService methods:
     - `unblockUser(pubkey)` for removing blocked accounts
     - `removeFromMuteList({type, value})` for removing words, tags, and threads
   - Provides proper error handling with try/catch
   - Logs success/failure messages for debugging

## Files Modified
- `src/app/pages/settings/privacy-settings/privacy-settings.component.ts`
  - Added `ReportingService` import
  - Injected `reportingService` 
  - Replaced placeholder `removeMutedItem` with proper implementation

## Implementation Details

### Method Signature
```typescript
async removeMutedItem(type: string, value: string): Promise<void>
```

### Type Mapping
- `'account'` â†’ Uses `reportingService.unblockUser(value)` 
- `'word'` â†’ Uses `reportingService.removeFromMuteList({type: 'word', value})`
- `'tag'` â†’ Uses `reportingService.removeFromMuteList({type: 't', value})`
- `'thread'` â†’ Uses `reportingService.removeFromMuteList({type: 'e', value})`

### Nostr Protocol Compliance
The implementation follows NIP-51 (Nostr Lists) specifications:
- Mute lists use kind 10000 events
- Different tag types for different mute categories:
  - `p` tags for muted pubkeys (accounts)
  - `word` tags for muted words
  - `t` tags for muted hashtags  
  - `e` tags for muted events/threads

## Testing
- âœ… Build completes successfully
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… All lint checks pass
- ðŸ”„ Manual testing required: User should verify that clicking remove buttons actually removes items from mute lists and publishes updates to relays

## User Experience
Users can now successfully remove items from their mute lists:
1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Privacy and Safety Settings
2. Scroll to the relevant mute section (Blocked Accounts, Muted Words, Muted Tags, Muted Threads)
3. Click the red X button next to any muted item
4. Item will be removed from the list and the updated mute list will be published to relays
5. Console logs will show success/error messages for debugging
