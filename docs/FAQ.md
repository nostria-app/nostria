# Nostria FAQ

### What is Nostria?
Nostria is a complete Nostr client designed for everyone from beginners to power users. It provides a modern, intuitive interface to experience the decentralized Nostr social network across all your devices.

### What is Nostr?
Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a decentralized social networking protocol that gives you full control over your data and identity. Unlike traditional social media, no single company controls the network.

### How do I get started with Nostria?
Simply visit [nostria.app](https://nostria.app/) and you can start using the platform immediately. Nostria is designed to be easy to use - you'll quickly get the hang of it, whether you're new to Nostr or a seasoned user.

### Do I need to create an account?
Nostr works differently than traditional social media. Instead of creating an account with a company, you generate a cryptographic key pair that serves as your identity across the entire Nostr network. You can use any Nostr client you want, even at the same time.

### Is Nostria available on mobile devices?
Yes! Nostria provides a seamless experience across all your devices - phone, tablet, and computer - with a consistent and intuitive interface.

### Why doesn't Nostria show followers count?
We believe that follower counts can create unnecessary pressure and competition, so we intentionally do not display them. Instead, we encourage meaningful interactions and connections.

Additionally the following count is not a reliable metric on Nostr due to the decentralized nature of the protocol.

Additionally it's something that requires queries across hundreds and thousands of relays to get an accurate count. Accurate counts 
is also not achieveable, due to spam and bots.

What should matter to you as a user, is discovering who anyone else is following. This is a statement of trust from one user to another, and is a much more meaningful metric than a follower count.

### Can I share media on Nostria?
Yes! Nostria includes integrated media sharing and viewing capabilities, making it easy to share photos, videos, and other content with your network.

### How does content filtering work?
Nostria provides powerful filtering and content discovery tools to help you find relevant content and users while avoiding unwanted material.

### Does Nostria support real-time updates?
Absolutely! You'll receive real-time updates across all your devices, ensuring you never miss important messages or interactions.

### What is Nostria Premium?
Nostria Premium unlocks advanced features and dedicated infrastructure including dedicated relays, media servers, discovery relays, and exclusive premium-only features.

### What are dedicated relays?
Premium users get priority access to high-performance relay networks, ensuring faster message delivery and better reliability compared to public relays.

### How do media servers work?
Premium subscribers can store and serve their media content through Nostria's globally distributed CDN (Content Delivery Network), providing faster loading times and better reliability.

### What are discovery relays?
These are specialized relays that help premium users find other users and content faster through dedicated discovery infrastructure.

### What advanced features are included in Premium?
Premium includes automated content backup, relay migration tools, verified usernames, Bitcoin payment addresses, and other exclusive features not available to free users.

### What relays does Nostria use?
Nostria connects to various Nostr relays to ensure good connectivity. Premium users get access to dedicated, high-performance relays for better reliability and speed.

### Can I use my existing Nostr identity with Nostria?
Yes! If you already have a Nostr identity (private/public key pair), you can import it into Nostria and continue using your existing profile and connections.

### Is my data secure?
Yes. Nostr's decentralized nature means your data isn't controlled by any single company. Your private key gives you full control over your identity and data.

### Can I backup my data?
Premium users get automated content backup. Free users can manually export their data and should always keep their private key secure as it's the only way to access their account.

### What happens if Nostria goes offline?
Since Nostr is decentralized, you can use any other Nostr client with your same identity. Your social graph and content exist on the Nostr network, not just on Nostria.

### I forgot my private key. Can you help me recover it?
Unfortunately, no. Private keys in Nostr cannot be recovered if lost - this is a fundamental security feature of the protocol. Always keep your private key secure and backed up.
