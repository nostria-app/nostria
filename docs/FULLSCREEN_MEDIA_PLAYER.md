# Fullscreen Media Player Feature

## Overview

This feature adds a fullscreen mode to the media player, allowing users to focus entirely on the media being watched or listened to without recreating any components or interrupting playback.

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

1. **LayoutService** (`src/app/services/layout.service.ts`)
   - Added `fullscreenMediaPlayer` signal to track fullscreen state
   
2. **MediaPlayerComponent** (`src/app/components/media-player/`)
   - Added `toggleFullscreen()` method to toggle fullscreen mode
   - Updated escape key listener to exit fullscreen mode
   - Added fullscreen button in both video and audio player controls
   - Enhanced CSS with smooth animations for fullscreen transitions

### Key Features

#### 1. Non-Destructive Expansion
The implementation uses CSS transforms and positioning to expand the existing media player container to fullscreen, ensuring:
- YouTube videos continue playing without interruption
- Audio playback is unaffected
- No component recreation or remounting
- State preservation across transitions

#### 2. Enhanced Animations
- **Duration**: 400ms (0.4s) for snappy, responsive transitions
- **Easing**: 
  - Expand: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` for smooth entry
  - Collapse: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1)` for smoother exit
- **Expand Animation** (`fullscreenExpand`): When entering fullscreen
  - Starts scaled down (90%) and translated down (20px) with full fade-in from opacity 0
  - Smoothly expands to full size and position
  - Creates a "zoom up and fade in" effect
- **Collapse Animation** (`fullscreenCollapse`): When exiting fullscreen
  - Starts at full scale and opacity
  - Scales down to 90% and translates down 20px while fading to opacity 0
  - Creates a smooth "zoom out and fade away" effect
- **Animation Logic**: 
  - Entering: Applies `fullscreen-mode` class with expand animation
  - Exiting: Temporarily applies `exiting-fullscreen` class for 400ms, then removes fullscreen state
  - Escape key triggers the same animated exit
- **Improved Exit**: Simplified keyframes with complete fade-out for cleaner visual effect
- **Snappy Timing**: 400ms provides quick response while maintaining smooth visuals

#### 3. Enhanced UI in Fullscreen
When in fullscreen mode:
- **Layout**: Content positioned above controls (vertical column layout)
- **Video Content**: Expands to fill viewport height minus 200px for controls
- **Audio Content**: Album artwork scales up to fill available space (calc(100vh - 250px))
- **Typography**: 
  - Song titles: 1.8em (up from 1.5em)
  - Artist names: 1.2em (up from 1.1em)
- **Controls**: 
  - Scaled up by 30% (1.3x) for better touch/click targets
  - Positioned below media content
  - Maximum width of 900px for optimal layout
- **Timeline**: Full scale (100%) for precise seeking
- **Background**: Uses theme surface color for consistent appearance

#### 4. Responsive Design
- Media info text becomes visible even on small screens in fullscreen
- Controls remain accessible and properly sized
- Works with both YouTube videos and native video elements
- Supports both audio and video content types

### User Interactions

#### Entering Fullscreen
- Click the fullscreen button (open_in_full icon) in the media player footer
- Available for both audio and video content

#### Exiting Fullscreen
- Click the close fullscreen button (close_fullscreen icon)
- Press the Escape key
- Close the media player entirely (exits fullscreen automatically)

### CSS Classes

- `.fullscreen-mode`: Applied to the media player footer container when fullscreen is active
- Positioned at `z-index: 9999` to overlay all other content
- Fixed positioning covering entire viewport
- Uses CSS Grid/Flexbox order property to position controls below content

### Animation Details

The fullscreen transition includes both expand and collapse animations with improved visual feedback:

```scss
/* Simple fade transition for footer re-appearance */
transition: opacity 0.4s ease-out;
animation: footerFadeIn 0.4s ease-out forwards;

/* Expanding animation when entering fullscreen */
@keyframes fullscreenExpand {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0.9) translateY(20px);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1) translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

/* Collapsing animation when exiting fullscreen */
@keyframes fullscreenCollapse {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1) translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(0.9) translateY(20px);
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

/* Simple fade-in for footer re-appearance */
@keyframes footerFadeIn {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

**Expand Effect** (Entering Fullscreen):
1. Starts scaled down to 90%, translated down 20px, and fully transparent (opacity 0)
2. Smoothly transitions to full scale, original position, and full opacity
3. Creates a natural "zoom up and fade in" effect

**Collapse Effect** (Exiting Fullscreen):
1. Starts at full size and opacity
2. Scales down to 90%, moves down 20px, and fades to completely transparent
3. Creates a clean "zoom out and fade away" effect that mirrors the entry

**Footer Re-appearance** (After Exiting Fullscreen):
1. Simple smooth fade-in from opacity 0 to 1
2. No scaling or translation - just a clean, subtle fade
3. Provides a gentle, non-distracting return to footer mode

**Timing**:
- All animations run at 400ms for snappy, responsive feel
- Exit animation uses `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1)` for slightly smoother finish
- Footer re-appearance uses simple `ease-out` for smooth fade
- Child elements fade in sync with the container

The animation is managed in TypeScript:
- When entering: Immediately applies `fullscreen-mode` class
- When exiting: Applies `exiting-fullscreen` class, waits 400ms, then removes fullscreen state
- Footer mode automatically gets `footerFadeIn` animation when it becomes visible

### Technical Details

#### State Management
```typescript
// LayoutService
fullscreenMediaPlayer = signal(false);

// MediaPlayerComponent
toggleFullscreen(): void {
  const currentState = this.layout.fullscreenMediaPlayer();
  
  if (currentState) {
    // Exiting fullscreen - add exit animation class
    this.isExitingFullscreen = true;
    const element = this.elementRef.nativeElement.querySelector('.media-player-footer');
    if (element) {
      element.classList.add('exiting-fullscreen');
    }
    
    // Wait for animation to complete before removing fullscreen mode
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.layout.fullscreenMediaPlayer.set(false);
      this.isExitingFullscreen = false;
      if (element) {
        element.classList.remove('exiting-fullscreen');
      }
    }, 400); // Match the animation duration (400ms)
  } else {
    // Entering fullscreen
    this.layout.fullscreenMediaPlayer.set(true);
  }
}
```

#### Z-Index Management
- **Fullscreen media player**: `z-index: 10000`
- **Mobile navigation**: `z-index: 1000`
- Ensures media player controls remain visible and accessible above mobile menu on small screens

#### Screen Space Optimization
- Videos expand to full viewport width (`100vw` instead of `90vw`)
- Media info container has zero padding in fullscreen mode
- Maximizes available screen space for content
- Controls positioned below content with adequate spacing

#### Escape Key Handler
```typescript
private escapeListener = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (event.key === 'Escape' && this.media.isFullscreen()) {
    this.media.exitFullscreen();
  }
  if (event.key === 'Escape' && this.layout.fullscreenMediaPlayer()) {
    this.layout.fullscreenMediaPlayer.set(false);
  }
};
```

### Browser Compatibility

- Uses modern CSS features (flexbox, viewport units)
- Smooth transitions supported in all modern browsers
- Degrades gracefully in older browsers (instant transition)

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add keyboard shortcuts (F11, F, etc.) for fullscreen toggle
2. Remember user's fullscreen preference
3. Add picture-in-picture mode integration
4. Support for dual monitors/external displays
5. Custom controls overlay in fullscreen mode
6. Gesture support for mobile devices (swipe to exit)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with YouTube videos (ensure no reload/recreation)
2. Test with native video elements
3. Test with audio content (podcast, music)
4. Test escape key functionality
5. Test on different screen sizes
6. Test theme switching in fullscreen mode
7. Test rapid toggling of fullscreen mode

## Notes

- The fullscreen button is hidden on small screens (using `hide-small` class)
- The implementation reuses existing media player structure
- No new dependencies or services required
- Fully integrated with existing theme system
