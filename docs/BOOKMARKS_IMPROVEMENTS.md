# Bookmarks Component Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the bookmarks component with multiple view types and a proper dialog for adding bookmarks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Add Bookmark Dialog Component
Created a new dialog component (`add-bookmark-dialog`) that replaces the simple `prompt()` function:

**Features:**
- Form fields for URL/ID, title (optional), and description (optional)
- Dropdown to select bookmark type (Website, Event, Article)
- URL validation based on selected type
- Material Design styling with proper form validation
- Save/Cancel actions

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/pages/bookmarks/add-bookmark-dialog/add-bookmark-dialog.component.ts`
- `src/app/pages/bookmarks/add-bookmark-dialog/add-bookmark-dialog.component.html`
- `src/app/pages/bookmarks/add-bookmark-dialog/add-bookmark-dialog.component.scss`

### 2. View Type Functionality
Added three different view types for displaying bookmarks:

#### Content View (default)
- Full event/article component rendering
- Best for reading content inline
- URL bookmarks shown as simple cards with links

#### Tiles View
- Grid layout with compact tiles
- Shows type icon, title, and description
- Ideal for visual browsing
- Each tile has quick delete action

#### Details View
- List layout with detailed information
- Shows icon, title, and metadata (type, date added)
- Compact single-line entries
- Good for scanning many bookmarks

**Features:**
- View type selector in header with icon button and menu
- Persists view preference to local storage
- Dynamic icon based on selected view type
- Responsive grid layout for tiles view

### 3. Component Updates

**TypeScript (`bookmarks.component.ts`):**
- Added `ViewType` type definition
- Added `viewType` signal with default 'content'
- Added `setViewType()` method to change views
- Added `getViewIcon()` method for dynamic icon display
- Updated `addBookmark()` to use the new dialog
- Added `saveViewType()` method for persistence
- Updated `loadFromStorage()` to restore view preference

**Template (`bookmarks.component.html`):**
- Added view type menu button in header
- Restructured bookmark rendering based on selected view
- Added tile and detail view templates
- Maintained existing content view behavior
- Added `data-view` attribute for CSS targeting

**Styles (`bookmarks.component.scss`):**
- Added styles for tiles view with grid layout
- Added styles for details view with list layout
- Added styles for content view URL cards
- Proper hover effects and transitions
- Responsive design with Material Design tokens
