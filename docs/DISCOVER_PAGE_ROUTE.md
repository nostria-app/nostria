# Discover Page Route Implementation

## Overview
Moved the followset onboarding component from conditional display within the People component to a dedicated route at `/people/discover`. This provides cleaner separation of concerns and better routing structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Discover Component (`src/app/pages/discover/discover.component.ts`)
Created a new standalone component that:
- Wraps the `FollowsetComponent` for interest-based profile discovery
- Manages starter pack loading and interest selection
- Handles followset completion by:
  - Following selected profiles via `AccountStateService`
  - Refreshing following columns in feeds
  - Navigating back to `/people` after completion
  - Showing success notification
- Provides a back button to return to `/people`

**Key Features:**
- Signals for reactive state management (`availableInterests`, `suggestedProfiles`, `selectedInterests`)
- Computed signal for `followingProfiles` from `AccountStateService`
- Region detection from account settings
- Error handling with user notifications

### 2. Updated Routing (`src/app/app.routes.ts`)
Added child route under the `people` path:
```typescript
{
  path: 'people',
  data: { isRoot: true },
  loadComponent: () => import('./pages/people/people.component').then(m => m.PeopleComponent),
  title: 'People',
  children: [
    {
      path: 'discover',
      loadComponent: () => import('./pages/discover/discover.component').then(m => m.DiscoverComponent),
      title: 'Discover People',
    },
  ],
}
```

### 3. Updated Navigation Links

#### Feeds Component (`src/app/pages/feeds/feeds.component.ts`)
- Changed `navigateToPeople()` to navigate to `/people/discover` instead of `/people`
- Empty following state now directs users to discovery page

#### People Component (`src/app/pages/people/people.component.html`)
- Changed "Find People" button to use `routerLink="/people/discover"` instead of `(click)="openFollowsetDialog()"`
- Removed conditional followset display (`@if (showFollowset() || hasEmptyFollowingList())`)
- Simplified template by removing inline followset integration

## User Flow

### New User Flow (Empty Following List)
1. User sees empty following state in feeds
2. Clicks "Discover People" button
3. Navigates to `/people/discover`
4. Selects interests and follows profiles
5. System follows accounts and refreshes feeds
6. Automatically navigates back to `/people`

### Existing User Flow
1. User navigates to `/people`
2. Clicks "Find People" button in header
3. Navigates to `/people/discover`
4. Discovers and follows new profiles
5. Returns to `/people` after completion

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Architecture**
   - Separates discovery UI from people management
   - Dedicated route for onboarding flow
   - Single responsibility per component

2. **Better Navigation**
   - Direct links to discovery flow
   - Proper browser history integration
   - Can bookmark discovery page

3. **Improved UX**
   - Clear entry points for discovering people
   - Consistent navigation patterns
   - Better back button handling

4. **Maintainability**
   - Easier to modify discovery flow independently
   - Reduced complexity in People component
   - Clear separation of concerns

## Technical Details

### Component Structure
```
src/app/pages/discover/
├── discover.component.ts
├── discover.component.html
└── discover.component.scss
```

### Dependencies
- `FollowsetComponent`: Interest selection and profile discovery
- `AccountStateService`: Following profiles
- `Followset` service: Starter pack management
- `NotificationService`: User feedback
- `FeedsCollectionService`: Refresh following columns
- `LoggerService`: Debug logging

### State Management
- Uses Angular signals for reactive updates
- Computed signals for derived state
- Proper cleanup and error handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation Tests**
   - Verify `/people/discover` route loads correctly
   - Test navigation from feeds empty state
   - Test navigation from people page button
   - Verify back button navigation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test followset completion flow
   - Verify profile following succeeds
   - Check feed refresh after following
   - Validate notification display

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Handle network errors during follow
   - Handle empty starter packs
   - Verify behavior with no interests selected
