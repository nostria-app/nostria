# Observed Relays - Background Color and Sorting Fix

## Overview
Fixed two issues with the Observed Relays feature:
1. Added a subtle background color differentiation for expanded relay details using Angular Material 3 design tokens
2. Fixed the non-functional sorting dropdown by implementing reactive sorting in the computed signal

## Issue 1: Expanded Details Background Color

### Problem
Expanded relay details had the same background color as the rest of the interface, making it less obvious that the section was expanded and belonged to the relay above it.

### Solution
Changed the background color from `var(--mat-app-background-color)` to `var(--mat-sys-surface-container-low)`.

**Before:**
```scss
.relay-expanded-details {
  background: var(--mat-app-background-color);
}
```

**After:**
```scss
.relay-expanded-details {
  background: var(--mat-sys-surface-container-low);
}
```

### Angular Material 3 Design Token
`--mat-sys-surface-container-low` is an official Angular Material 3 (M3) design token that provides a slightly elevated surface color. It's part of the Material Design 3 color system and automatically adapts to:
- Light theme: Slightly darker than the base background
- Dark theme: Slightly lighter than the base background

This creates a subtle visual hierarchy without custom colors.

### Visual Result
- ✅ Expanded details now have a visually distinct background
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy showing the expansion belongs to the relay
- ✅ Maintains Material Design 3 consistency
- ✅ Automatically adapts to light/dark themes
- ✅ Subtle and professional appearance

## Issue 2: Non-Functional Sorting

### Problem
The "Sort by" dropdown allowed users to select different sort criteria (Events Received, Last Updated, First Observed), but the list didn't actually re-sort when the selection changed.

**Root Cause:**
The `observedRelays` computed signal was directly returning the service's signal without applying any sorting logic:

```typescript
observedRelays = computed(() => {
  return this.relaysService.observedRelaysSignal();
});
```

### Solution
Implemented reactive sorting within the computed signal that automatically responds to changes in `observedRelaysSortBy`:

```typescript
observedRelays = computed(() => {
  const sortBy = this.observedRelaysSortBy();
  const relays = this.relaysService.observedRelaysSignal();
  
  // Sort the relays based on the selected criteria
  return [...relays].sort((a, b) => {
    switch (sortBy) {
      case 'eventsReceived':
        return b.eventsReceived - a.eventsReceived;
      case 'firstObserved':
        return a.firstObserved - b.firstObserved;
      case 'lastUpdated':
      default:
        return b.lastUpdated - a.lastUpdated;
    }
  });
});
```

### How It Works

1. **Reactive Computed Signal**: The `computed()` function automatically tracks dependencies. When `observedRelaysSortBy()` changes, the entire computed signal re-evaluates.

2. **Sort Logic**:
   - **Events Received**: Descending order (most events first) - `b - a`
   - **First Observed**: Ascending order (oldest first) - `a - b`
   - **Last Updated**: Descending order (most recent first) - `b - a` (default)

3. **Array Spreading**: Uses `[...relays]` to create a new array before sorting, preventing mutation of the source array.

4. **Automatic Updates**: Template automatically re-renders when the computed signal changes, no manual method calls needed.

### Code Cleanup

Removed the now-unnecessary `onObservedRelaysSortChange()` method:

**Before:**
```typescript
onObservedRelaysSortChange(): void {
  // Trigger re-sort when sort criteria changes
  // The computed signal will automatically update when observedRelaysSortBy changes
}
```

**After:** Method removed entirely - computed signals handle reactivity automatically.

**Template Update:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<select (change)="observedRelaysSortBy.set($any($event.target).value); onObservedRelaysSortChange()">

<!-- After -->
<select (change)="observedRelaysSortBy.set($any($event.target).value)">
```

### Visual Result
- ✅ Sorting now works immediately when dropdown changes
- ✅ "Events Received" sorts by event count (highest first)
- ✅ "Last Updated" sorts by most recently updated (default)
- ✅ "First Observed" sorts by oldest relays first
- ✅ No flickering or delay - instant sorting
- ✅ No unnecessary method calls - pure reactive approach

## Technical Details

### Angular Signals Pattern
This implementation follows Angular's reactive programming model with signals:
- **Signal**: `observedRelaysSortBy` - reactive state
- **Computed**: `observedRelays` - automatically derives from signals
- **Template**: Automatically re-renders when computed values change

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient**: Only re-sorts when sort criteria changes, not on every CD cycle
- **Immutable**: Creates new sorted array without mutating source
- **Lightweight**: Sort operation is fast even with hundreds of relays
- **No Memory Leaks**: Signals manage subscriptions automatically

### Material Design 3 Surface Levels
Angular Material 3 provides several surface container levels:
- `--mat-sys-surface` - Base surface
- `--mat-sys-surface-container-lowest` - Slightly elevated
- `--mat-sys-surface-container-low` - More elevated (we use this)
- `--mat-sys-surface-container` - Standard container
- `--mat-sys-surface-container-high` - Prominent container
- `--mat-sys-surface-container-highest` - Most prominent

We chose `surface-container-low` as it provides subtle differentiation without being too prominent.

## Testing

### Background Color
Test in both themes:
1. **Light Theme**: Expanded details should be slightly darker/grayer
2. **Dark Theme**: Expanded details should be slightly lighter
3. **Transition**: Smooth color transition during expand/collapse animation

### Sorting
Test all sort options:
1. **Events Received**: Verify highest event count appears first
2. **Last Updated**: Verify most recently updated appears first
3. **First Observed**: Verify oldest relay appears first
4. **Immediate Update**: List should re-sort instantly on dropdown change

## Browser Compatibility

All features use standard Angular and CSS:
- Signals: Angular 16+
- CSS Custom Properties: All modern browsers
- No compatibility concerns

## Performance Impact

Minimal impact:
- Sorting: O(n log n) complexity, fast even with 100+ relays
- Computed signal: Only re-evaluates when dependencies change
- CSS: Static color variable, no runtime cost

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/pages/settings/relays/relays.component.scss`**
   - Changed expanded details background to `--mat-sys-surface-container-low`

2. **`src/app/pages/settings/relays/relays.component.ts`**
   - Updated `observedRelays` computed signal with sorting logic
   - Removed `onObservedRelaysSortChange()` method

3. **`src/app/pages/settings/relays/relays.component.html`**
   - Removed call to `onObservedRelaysSortChange()` from select element

## Key Takeaways

1. **Use Material Design Tokens**: Leverage official design tokens for theme-aware colors
2. **Reactive Signals**: Let computed signals handle reactivity automatically
3. **Immutable Sorting**: Always create new arrays when sorting to avoid mutations
4. **Declarative Approach**: Prefer computed signals over imperative methods
5. **Material 3 Surface Hierarchy**: Use appropriate surface levels for visual hierarchy
