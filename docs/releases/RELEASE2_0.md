Nostria has come a long way since its inception, and with the release of version 2.0, we are excited to introduce a host of new features and improvements that will enhance your experience on our decentralized social networking platform.

All development happens in the open for Nostria, so if you've already been using it, you will already have experienced some of these new features.

# What's New in Nostria 2.0
## Music [/music](https://nostria.app/music)
Nostria 2.0 introduces native support for music sharing and discovery. Users can now upload, share, and listen to music tracks directly within the platform. This feature includes playlist creation and track uploading. Earn zaps and give appreciation to your favorite artists directly through zapping. When you publish music track or playlists, you can choose a custom set of relays, ensuring your music is available where you want it to be. We've also improved the music player, with tree different views, including one that mimics WinAmp with a functional equalizer. You can also view song lyrics.

## Search [/search](https://nostria.app/search)
Finding content and users on a decentralized platform can be challenging. Nostria 2.0 includes a powerful search feature that allows users to search for posts, profiles, and hashtags across the entire network, making it easier to discover new content and connect with others.

## Live Streams [/streams](https://nostria.app/streams)
We've further enhanced our live streaming capabilities, with an improved interface, chat replies and emojii reactions. We've integrated the Game API which shows rich details about the game being played during a live stream. It's easier to hide the stream chat and stream info, giving you a fully impressive experience.

## Articles [/articles](https://nostria.app/articles)
We added a dedicated section for long-form articles, allowing users to publish and read in-depth content. Articles support rich formatting, images, and links, making it easy to share detailed information and stories. It has now been removed from the default feeds.

![nostria-articles.png](https://mibo.eu.nostria.app/ef49c2a78f4d5d25ead7bdce52c8bf710b497ed67e72e03f5a68d182e2b36d7a.webp)

## Summary [/summary](https://nostria.app/summary)
This is a powerful feature that provides users with an hourly, daily or weekly summary of their activities, interactions, and important updates on the platform. It presents a compressed timeline view that makes it easy to catch up on what you've missed.

![nostria-summary.png](https://mibo.eu.nostria.app/df0e459f9f2b475a1e1067079cd4622fb32caba069e873a8f073ae27ef9d08c8.webp)

## Messages [/messages](https://nostria.app/messages)
Improved support for remote signer, relying on a queue system to ensure the relays and signer is not overwhelmed with requests. Nostria is already behaving well with extension signers, avoiding many popups before the user interacts. Added search for messages, making it easier to find specific conversations.

## Notifications [/notifications](https://nostria.app/notifications)
Improved the display of notifications, showing preview for all kinds of events. Added search for notifications, making it easier to find specific interactions.

## Discover [/discover](https://nostria.app/discover)
New section to discover content, profiles and more. Each category contains curated lists to help you find interesting content and people to follow.

![nostria-discover.png](https://mibo.eu.nostria.app/4fc81dac2eeb9e37c5c5278f2ba8e6c3a53f4e5b95f4b87728a54de800940fe3.webp)

## Publish Media
There is a new option to publish media content. This is a simpler way to share images and videos. When you publish media, your content is then optimized for display in apps that support media events. Nostria will automatically post a short form post with a preview of the media, making it discoverable across all types of Nostr clients. You find it when you click the "+" button to create a new post. You can quickly capture a photo with your phone and publish in seconds.

![nostria-publish-media.png](https://mibo.eu.nostria.app/6ed210450c9239988b101b0a287889ae8acb0798f01a765cc62e79c273f20e02.webp)

## Remote Signer
Improved support for remote signer through client-initiated connection. This allows users to connect to their remote signer by simply scanning a QR code, without needing to manually enter connection details.

## Content Reveal
You can now choose "Always reveal this user" on media, allowing you to automatically see content from specific users, without needing to follow them.

## Profile Discovery
Nostria is built on the outbox model, which makes it possible to scale globally with ease. Everyone can post on their own relays, anywhere in the world, and still be discoverable by others. Unfortunately a lot of users on Nostr have been moving across multiple relays, often not bringing with them their profile information (and other events). With Nostria 2.0, we have implemented a robust profile discovery mechanism that will find a user profile, even when it's not available on the user's own relays - and then automatically publish their profiles to their relays, making them easily discoverable by others.

## Calendars
The world is big and it has many languages and cultures. To better support this diversity, we've added support for multiple calendar systems in Nostria 2.0. Users can now choose their preferred calendar system, such as Gregorian, Chronia (13 months) and Ethiopian. While the whole app is not translated to all supported languages yet, we did add Spanish and French just recently. There is so much new features added still, so when there is less new stuff, we will focus more on translations.

# Premium
We've given some love to our Premium subscription service, adding new features and benefits for our subscribers.

## YouTube [/youtube](https://nostria.app/youtube)
Premium users can now add YouTube channels in the app, to get a distraction free experience when watching videos.

## Memos [/memos](https://nostria.app/memos)
Memos allows you to keep private notes and thoughts, which are only visible to you.
![nostria-memos.png](https://mibo.eu.nostria.app/62db8b1bb1e27fd6ce435e21614c808946a5f1238be84d332f8e2bb3b747997d.webp)

## Analytics (Beta) [/analytics](https://nostria.app/analytics)
Get insights into your profile's performance, including follower growth, engagement metrics, and content reach. This is early preview of the feature, it will get many improvements over time.

![nostria-analytics.png](https://mibo.eu.nostria.app/a00ae7a3f77fc8bea7fc222ff44eee9d9b37235818a5870b07e255722d1b0a83.webp)

## Backup [/backup](https://nostria.app/backup)
Added an automatic backup of your following lists. This will help you avoid loosing your follows, which can happen when you use the same account across multiple clients. If you get into trouble one day, you can either restore an older list or merge (combine) your current list with the backup.

![nostria-following-backup.png](https://mibo.eu.nostria.app/2d175b88849b9f59314f7c430a28b542b5b62ba94cd4c64a025fc326f175841b.webp)
