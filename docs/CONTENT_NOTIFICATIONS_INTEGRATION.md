# Content Notifications Integration Complete

## Overview

The Content Notification service has been fully integrated into the Nostria application. This document describes the integration and how the system works.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Service Integration in App Component

The `ContentNotificationService` has been integrated into the main `App` component (`app.ts`):

- **Import Added**: The service is imported at the top of the file
- **Injection**: The service is injected using Angular's `inject()` function
- **Initialization**: The service is initialized in `ngOnInit()` after storage initialization
- **Initial Check**: An initial notification check runs on app startup (for authenticated users only)
- **Periodic Checks**: The service checks for new notifications every 5 minutes for authenticated users

### 2. UI Changes

The notifications component UI has been updated to remove the counter badge from the System notifications tab:

**Before:**
- Activity tab: Badge showing content notification count ✅
- System tab: Badge showing system notification count ❌

**After:**
- Activity tab: Badge showing content notification count ✅
- System tab: No badge (removed) ✅

This change ensures that only social interactions (Activity) show a count badge, while technical system notifications remain visible but don't clutter the UI with additional badges.

## How It Works

### Startup Sequence

1. **App Initialization** (`app.ts` ngOnInit):
   ```typescript
   - Storage initializes
   - ContentNotificationService.initialize() is called
     - Loads last check timestamp from LocalStorage
   - If user is authenticated:
     - ContentNotificationService.checkForNewNotifications() runs
     - Queries Nostr relays for 6 types of events since last check
   ```

2. **Periodic Checks**:
   - Every 5 minutes, the service checks for new notifications
   - Only runs if user is authenticated
   - Uses "since" parameter to avoid duplicate events

### Notification Flow

```
User logs in
    ↓
App initializes ContentNotificationService
    ↓
Service queries Nostr relays for:
  - New followers (kind 3 events)
  - Mentions (kind 1 events with 'p' tags)
  - Reposts (kind 6 events)
  - Replies (kind 1 events with reply markers)
  - Reactions (kind 7 events)
  - Zaps (kind 9735 events)
    ↓
For each matching event:
  - Creates ContentNotification
  - Persists to IndexedDB via NotificationService
  - Updates UI via signals
    ↓
User sees notifications in Activity tab
    ↓
Every 5 minutes: Repeat check
```

## Configuration

### Check Interval

The periodic check interval is set to **5 minutes** in `app.ts`:

```typescript
setInterval(async () => {
  if (this.app.authenticated()) {
    await this.contentNotificationService.checkForNewNotifications();
  }
}, 5 * 60 * 1000); // 5 minutes
```

To change the interval, modify the value `5 * 60 * 1000` (in milliseconds).

**Recommended intervals:**
- 1 minute: `1 * 60 * 1000` (frequent checks, more network usage)
- 5 minutes: `5 * 60 * 1000` (balanced, current default)
- 15 minutes: `15 * 60 * 1000` (less frequent, lower network usage)
- 30 minutes: `30 * 60 * 1000` (infrequent checks)

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Initial Check**:
   - Log out of the app
   - Have someone follow you, mention you, or interact with your content
   - Log back in
   - Check the Activity tab in Notifications
   - You should see the new interactions

2. **Test Periodic Checks**:
   - Leave the app open
   - Have someone interact with your content
   - Wait 5 minutes
   - Check the Activity tab
   - You should see the new notifications

3. **Test Badge Display**:
   - Navigate to Notifications page
   - Verify Activity tab shows a badge with the count
   - Verify System tab shows NO badge
   - Mark Activity notifications as read
   - Verify badge count decreases

### Browser Console Testing

Open the browser console and check for log messages:

```
[App] Initializing content notification service
[App] Content notification service initialized successfully
[App] Initial content notification check completed
[App] Periodic content notification check completed (every 5 minutes)
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication Required**: Content notifications only work for authenticated users. If not logged in, the service skips checks.

2. **Relay Dependency**: Notifications depend on the account relay service. If relays are unavailable or slow, notifications may be delayed.

3. **Timestamp Accuracy**: The service uses the last check timestamp to avoid duplicates. If the clock skews or LocalStorage is cleared, you may see duplicate notifications or miss some.

4. **Profile Information**: Currently, notifications show author pubkeys. Future enhancement: show profile names and avatars.

5. **No Real-Time Updates**: The system uses periodic polling (5 minutes). Real-time notifications would require WebSocket subscriptions to relays.

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Preferences**: Add settings to enable/disable specific notification types
2. **Profile Display**: Show user names and avatars instead of pubkeys
3. **Real-Time WebSockets**: Replace polling with relay subscriptions for instant notifications
4. **Notification Sounds**: Add optional sound alerts for new notifications
5. **Desktop Notifications**: Integrate with browser notification API for desktop alerts
6. **Adaptive Polling**: Adjust check frequency based on activity level

## Troubleshooting

### No Notifications Appearing

**Check:**
1. Are you logged in? (Content notifications require authentication)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify your relays are responding (Settings → Relays)
4. Check if timestamp is set: `localStorage.getItem('lastContentNotificationCheck')`

**Solutions:**
- Clear LocalStorage and refresh to reset timestamp
- Check network tab for Nostr relay requests
- Verify account relay service is connected

### Duplicate Notifications

**Possible Causes:**
- LocalStorage timestamp was cleared
- Clock skew between client and relays
- Multiple tabs open running concurrent checks

**Solutions:**
- Close extra tabs
- Clear all notifications and reset timestamp
- Wait for next periodic check

### Badge Not Updating

**Check:**
1. Are the notifications marked as read?
2. Check browser console for signal update errors
3. Verify notification type is correctly categorized

**Solutions:**
- Mark notifications as read manually
- Refresh the page to reset signal state
- Check `isContentNotification()` method in component

## Files Modified

- `src/app/app.ts` - Added service injection and initialization
- `src/app/pages/notifications/notifications.component.html` - Removed system badge
- `src/app/services/content-notification.service.ts` - Main service (already existed)
- `src/app/services/storage.service.ts` - Notification types (already existed)

## Summary

The Content Notification system is now fully operational:

✅ Service integrated into app startup
✅ Initial check on login
✅ Periodic checks every 5 minutes
✅ Activity badge shows count
✅ System badge removed
✅ Authentication-aware (only runs for logged-in users)
✅ Zero compilation errors

The implementation follows Angular best practices with signals, computed properties, and proper service injection. The system is production-ready and can be extended with additional features as needed.
