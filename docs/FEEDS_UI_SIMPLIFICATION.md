# Feeds UI Simplification

## Overview
Simplified the feeds component header by removing duplicate code between mobile and desktop views. The action buttons (Add Feed, Add Column, More Options) are now unified and rendered consistently across all viewport sizes.

## Changes Made

### Template (feeds.component.html)

**Before:**
- Had separate code blocks for mobile (`@if (isMobileView())`) and desktop (`@else`) views
- Action buttons (Add Feed, Add Column, More Options menu) were duplicated in both blocks
- ~170 lines of duplicate code with identical functionality

**After:**
- Feed tabs are the only element that changes between mobile/desktop:
  - **Mobile**: Dropdown menu button with feed selector
  - **Desktop**: Horizontal tab buttons for each feed
- Action buttons unified into single `.feed-actions` div
- Removed ~120 lines of duplicate code
- Same functionality across all viewports

### Styles (feeds.component.scss)

**Before:**
- `.feed-selector` used `align-items: flex-start`
- Had `.mobile-selectors` container with extra nesting and unused styles

**After:**
- `.feed-selector` now uses:
  - `align-items: center` - Better vertical alignment
  - `justify-content: space-between` - Pushes action buttons to the right
- Removed `.mobile-selectors` and related nested styles
- Cleaner, more maintainable CSS

## UI Improvements

1. **Action Buttons Positioning**: 
   - Now appear on the **right side** of the header
   - Consistent placement in both mobile and desktop views

2. **Code Maintainability**:
   - Single source of truth for action buttons
   - Easier to add/modify buttons without duplicating changes
   - Reduced template size by ~40%

3. **Visual Consistency**:
   - Same button styles and behavior across all screen sizes
   - Only the feed selector changes presentation (dropdown vs tabs)

## Structure

```html
<div class="feed-selector">
  <!-- Left: Feed tabs (responsive) -->
  <div class="feed-tabs">
    @if (isMobileView()) {
      <!-- Dropdown menu for feeds -->
    } @else {
      <!-- Tab buttons for feeds -->
    }
  </div>

  <!-- Right: Action buttons (same for all) -->
  <div class="feed-actions">
    <button>Add Feed</button>
    <button>Add Column</button>
    <button>More Options</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
