  <p>
    Nostria uses advanced AI models that run directly on your device. This means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> Your data never leaves your device. No cloud servers are involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Offline Capable:</strong> Once downloaded, models work without an internet connection.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Processing happens on your hardware, which may be slower than cloud services
      depending on your device's capabilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The first time you use an AI feature, the app will download and cache the necessary model.
    This may take a few moments and use some data.
