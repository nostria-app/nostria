    Welcome to Nostria Beta! This page explains what it means to be using our
    software during this development phase.
  </p>

  <h2>Development in Progress</h2>
  <p>
    Nostria is currently under active development and is in beta status. This
    means that a significant amount of functionality is not fully implemented or
    may not work as expected. You may encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or
    incomplete features while using the application.
  </p>

  <h2>Open Development</h2>
  <p>
    Nostria is being developed fully in the open. This means we don't deploy or
    work in secret before revealing functionality â€” all new features and
    improvements are made available and updated continuously, often multiple
    times a day. You're seeing Nostria as it evolves in real-time.
  </p>

  <h2>Before Official Release</h2>
  <p>
    This development process will continue until we reach the official release
    date, which will be announced in the future. Until then, you're experiencing
    the software as it's being built and refined.
