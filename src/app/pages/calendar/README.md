## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Reactive signals for state
events = signal<CalendarEvent[]>([]);
selectedDate = signal<Date>(new Date());
viewMode = signal<'month' | 'week' | 'agenda'>('month');

// Computed values for derived state
currentMonth = computed(() => { /* month calculations */ });
calendarGrid = computed(() => { /* calendar grid generation */ });
agendaEvents = computed(() => { /* grouped events by date */ });
```

### Event Loading
- **Relay Integration**: Uses `AccountRelayService` for Nostr communication
- **Subscription-based**: Real-time event updates through Nostr subscriptions
- **Date Range Filtering**: Efficient loading of events for visible date ranges
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling of relay connection issues

### Accessibility
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper accessibility labels for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Color Contrast**: Material Design ensures proper contrast ratios
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators
